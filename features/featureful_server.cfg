monsters_delegate_squad_leadership true

// Whether monsters get health from eating meat or enemy corpses
monsters_eat_for_health true

// Half-Life makes monsters with non-empty targetname to wait 5 seconds after spawn before AI gets to normal.
// This probably was designed to prevent important monsters from being distracted from scripts.
// It's debatable whether this is actually required and we leave things like this until proper investigation.
// This behavior however most notably affects named monsters coming from monstermakers, so we add a feature to control whether such monsters are affected.
monsters_spawned_named_wait_trigger true

// Whether monsters block player movement while in dying animation.
// This is standard Half-Life behavior which becomes problematic when the dying animation is too long (e.g. bullsquid's one)

/////////
// GARGANTUA
/////////
